Certainly! To interact with your Flask application using `curl`, you'll need to perform a **multipart/form-data** POST request to the `/process` endpoint, uploading two files: `frame1` and `frame2`. Below, I'll provide a detailed explanation of how to construct this `curl` command, along with an example.

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Flask Application Running**: Ensure that your Flask app is running. By default, it should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/`. If you've configured it differently (e.g., running on a different host or port), adjust the URL accordingly.

2. **Files to Upload**: Prepare the two files you want to upload. These can be either Excel (`.xlsx`) or CSV (`.csv`) files. For this example, let's assume you have:
   - `user_framework.xlsx`
   - `service_framework.xlsx`

### **Constructing the `curl` Command**

The `curl` command will perform the following actions:

1. **Specify the HTTP Method**: Use `POST` since you're uploading data.
2. **Attach Files**: Use the `-F` (or `--form`) option to specify form fields and attach files.
3. **Define Form Fields**:
   - `frame1`: The first file.
   - `frame2`: The second file.
4. **Set the Destination URL**: Point to the `/process` endpoint of your Flask app.
5. **Handle the Response**: Save the output (merged CSV) to a local file using the `--output` (or `-o`) option.

### **Example `curl` Command**

Here's how you can structure your `curl` command based on the above:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -F "frame1=@/path/to/user_framework.xlsx" \
     -F "frame2=@/path/to/service_framework.xlsx" \
     http://localhost:5000/process \
     --output framework1_with_results.csv
```

#### **Breaking Down the Command:**

- `curl`: The command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.
- `-X POST`: Specifies the HTTP method to use (`POST` in this case).
- `-F "frame1=@/path/to/user_framework.xlsx"`: 
  - `-F` indicates a form field.
  - `"frame1=@/path/to/user_framework.xlsx"` tells `curl` to upload the file located at `/path/to/user_framework.xlsx` as the form field named `frame1`.
- `-F "frame2=@/path/to/service_framework.xlsx"`: Similarly, uploads the second file as `frame2`.
- `http://localhost:5000/process`: The URL endpoint of your Flask application where the files will be processed.
- `--output framework1_with_results.csv`: Saves the response from the server (the merged CSV) to a local file named `framework1_with_results.csv`.

### **Customizing the Command**

1. **File Paths**: Replace `/path/to/user_framework.xlsx` and `/path/to/service_framework.xlsx` with the actual paths to your files. For example, if your files are in the current directory:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
        -F "frame1=@user_framework.xlsx" \
        -F "frame2=@service_framework.xlsx" \
        http://localhost:5000/process \
        --output framework1_with_results.csv
   ```

2. **URL Adjustment**: If your Flask app is hosted on a different domain or port, adjust the URL accordingly. For example, if it's hosted on `http://example.com` and port `8000`:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
        -F "frame1=@user_framework.xlsx" \
        -F "frame2=@service_framework.xlsx" \
        http://example.com:8000/process \
        --output framework1_with_results.csv
   ```

### **Handling Different File Types**

The Flask app is configured to accept both `.xlsx` and `.csv` files. Ensure that the files you're uploading are in one of these formats. If you attempt to upload a file with an unsupported extension, the Flask app will respond with an error message, which will be captured by `curl` unless you specifically handle it.

### **Verifying the Response**

After running the `curl` command:

1. **Check the Output File**: Ensure that `framework1_with_results.csv` has been created in your current directory. This file should contain the merged results from your Flask application's processing.

2. **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong (e.g., missing files, server errors), `curl` will display the error message in the terminal. Ensure that your Flask app is running and accessible, and that the files are correctly specified.

### **Advanced Usage**

- **Verbose Output**: To get more details about the request and response (useful for debugging), add the `-v` flag:

  ```bash
  curl -v -X POST \
       -F "frame1=@user_framework.xlsx" \
       -F "frame2=@service_framework.xlsx" \
       http://localhost:5000/process \
       --output framework1_with_results.csv
  ```

- **Silent Mode**: To suppress progress and error messages, use the `-s` flag. Combine it with `-S` to still show errors:

  ```bash
  curl -sS -X POST \
       -F "frame1=@user_framework.xlsx" \
       -F "frame2=@service_framework.xlsx" \
       http://localhost:5000/process \
       --output framework1_with_results.csv
  ```

- **Including Headers**: If your Flask app requires specific headers (e.g., authentication tokens), you can include them using the `-H` option:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
       -F "frame1=@user_framework.xlsx" \
       -F "frame2=@service_framework.xlsx" \
       http://localhost:5000/process \
       --output framework1_with_results.csv
  ```

  *(Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token.)*

### **Summary**

The provided `curl` command allows you to interact programmatically with your Flask application by uploading two files and retrieving the processed merged CSV. Here's the command again for quick reference:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -F "frame1=@/path/to/user_framework.xlsx" \
     -F "frame2=@/path/to/service_framework.xlsx" \
     http://localhost:5000/process \
     --output framework1_with_results.csv
```

**Ensure that:**

- The Flask app is running and accessible at the specified URL.
- The file paths are correct and point to existing `.xlsx` or `.csv` files.
- You have the necessary permissions to read the input files and write the output file.

Feel free to adjust the command based on your specific environment and requirements. If you encounter any issues, enabling verbose mode (`-v`) can help diagnose the problem.
